# Certificato

Certificato is a web app developed using Streamlit to help users send certificates in large quantities when provided with an excel sheet containing the name and email address of the recipients.

## 📝 Features

* The app reads the Excel sheet, extracts the name of the recipient, and creates a customized certificate with the provided name. The certificate is then sent to the recipient's email address.

* The app is designed to use the app password of the Google account instead of the usual account password, as per the new Google security rule which doesn't allow third-party integration. This ensures that the user's account is protected and secure.

* In addition to the current functionality, the future updates of Certificato will include the option to use sample certificates and templates and make edits on those. This feature will provide users with more flexibility in creating certificates and personalizing them according to their needs.

* One of the key features of Certificato is its simplicity and ease of use. Users can upload their Excel sheet, select the certificate template, and send the certificates with just a few clicks. The app takes care of the rest, including creating the certificates and sending them to the recipient's email address.

* Another advantage of Certificato is its compatibility with both Windows and Linux servers. This makes it a versatile app that can be used in various environments and by users with different technical backgrounds.
