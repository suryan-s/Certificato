# Certificato

Certificato is a web app developed using Streamlit to help users send certificates in large quantities when provided with an excel sheet containing the name and email address of the recipients.

## 📝 Features

* Reads an Excel sheet with name and email address of recipients and sends certificates to their email addresses.
* Uses app password of Google account instead of usual account password as per the new Google security rule which doesn't allow third-party integration.
* Future updates will include a feature to use sample certificates and templates and make edits on those.
